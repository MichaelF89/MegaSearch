Evaluate your results Let 2 persons assess the relevancy of the top 10 documents for 5 different queries. Compute Cohen's kappa. Determine 
the average precision at 10 for your system based on these 5 queries, and the two relevance assesments. Also plot the P@10 
(for both judges) for each query, showing differences in hard and easy queries.

Describe clearly how you solved differences in judgements. 

So, both provide the actual query, and a description of the information need that was behind the query. 
Give a small set of clear guidelines for judging the results, and let your judges follow these guidelines. 
  It is far more interesting to have difficult queries (both for the search engine and for the judges) than to have queries on which all 
ten retrieved documents are relevant. So, try to create a good list of information needs. 
  Change the ranking of your system, compute the average precision at 10 using your 5 queries, compare the results to your old system, and 
EXPLAIN what is going on.
